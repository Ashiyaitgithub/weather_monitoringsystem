        <h1>Weather Monitoring System</h1>
        <p>Tracking and analyzing weather conditions in real-time.The "Weather Monitoring System" is a
            project that brings the power of Internet
            of Things (IoT) technology to environmental data monitoring. This system is designed to offer
            real-time insights into crucial atmospheric parameters like temperature,
            humidity, and overall environmental conditions, all accessible through the user-friendly Blynk app
            interface. By integrating a suite of sensors and IoT technology, we enable users to directly deploy
            the system in the field, obtaining live data feeds on their preferred devices, including smartphones
            and tablets. The data generated by these sensors can be effortlessly shared and viewed remotely
            via Blynk, making environmental data accessible anytime, anywhere. With Blynk's intuitive
            platform, users can effectively analyze and visualize this data, facilitating informed decisionmaking and
            promoting environmental awareness. This project is poised to revolutionize
            atmospheric monitoring, placing valuable insights at the fingertips of farmers, weather forecasters,
            and environmental researchers, all through the convenience of the Blynk app interface</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
           <pre>

            1. Blynk Configuration:
            -The Blynk template ID, device name, and authentication token are defined for Blynk integration.
            -The 'BLYNK_PRINT' is set to 'Serial' for debugging purposes.

            2. Libraries and Objects:
            - The necessary libraries for WiFi, Blynk, DHT sensor, Wire, and LiquidCrystal_I2C are included.
            - A 'LiquidCrystal_I2' object 'lcd' is created to control the LCD display.
            - A custom character (degree symbol) is defined for later use.

            3. WiFi and Blynk Initialization:
            - WiFi credentials ('ssid' and 'pass') are provided.
            - Blynk is initialized with the authentication token, WiFi credentials, and the Blynk timer is set up to
            call the 'sendSensor' function every 30 seconds.

            4. Sensor Reading and Blynk Updates:
            - The 'sendSensor' function reads temperature, humidity, and gas values.
            - If the DHT sensor readings are valid (not NaN), the values are sent to Blynk virtual pins (`V0`, `V1`, and
            `V2`) for display in the Blynk app.

            5. LCD Display Setup:
            - The LCD is initialized and displays an introductory message for 2 seconds before clearing the screen.

            6. Main Loop:
            - The 'loop' function runs continuously.
            - Blynk is serviced ('Blynk.run()') and the Blynk timer is checked ('timer.run()').
            - The temperature, humidity, and gas values are read again for local display on the LCD.
            - Depending on the gas value, different messages are displayed on the LCD indicating whether the air quality
            is "Fresh Air" or "Bad Air."
            - If the gas value is above 600, a Blynk event log is created to indicate "Bad Air."

            7. LCD Display of Sensor Values:
            - The LCD displays temperature, humidity, and gas values in different sections on the screen with
            appropriate units.
            - Custom characters are used for better visual representation.

            This is designed for an ESP32 microcontroller with sensors for temperature, humidity (DHT sensor), and
            gas, along with an LCD display for local monitoring. The Blynk integration allows remote monitoring and
            alerting. The gas value is used to determine air quality, and actions (such as logging an event) are taken
            based on the threshold value of 600. The LCD provides a local interface for quick feedback on the air
            quality.
